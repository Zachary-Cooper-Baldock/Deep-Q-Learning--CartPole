    "As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses an action, the environment transitions to a new state, and also returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more than 2.4 units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.). We take these 4 inputs without any scaling and pass them through a small fully-connected network with 2 outputs, one for each action. The network is trained to predict the expected value for each action, given the input state. The action with the highest expected value is then chosen."

The discount $\\gamma$ should be constant between 0 and 1 and ensures that the cumulative sum converges. A lower $\\gamma$ makes the rewards from the uncertain far future less important for our agent than the ones in the near future that it can be fairly confident about. It encourages agents to collect reward closer in time than equivalent rewards that are temporally far away in the future. \n",

    "Actions are chosen either randomly or based on a policy, getting the next step sample from the gym environment. We record the results in the replay memory and also run optimization step on every iteration. Optimization picks a random batch from the replay memory to do training of the new policy. The “older” target_net is also used in optimization to compute the expected Q values. A soft update of its weights are performed at every step.\n",
